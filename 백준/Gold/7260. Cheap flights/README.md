### 문제 설명

<p>Justas built a passenger airplane, and now he wants to start a low cost airline, called Justas Airlines.</p>

<p>Justas made a list of the N most popular cities among tourists, and calculated which routes between these cities would be profitable. Each route connects two cities. The profitability of the route indicates how many Euros per month Justas Airlines would earn by operating the route.</p>

<p>Routes have to be chosen so that any two routes have one city in common. Calculate the maximum profit that Justas Airlines can make in one month.</p>

### 입력

No two routes connect the same pair of cities.</p>
